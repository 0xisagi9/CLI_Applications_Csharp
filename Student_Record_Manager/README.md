# 🏫 Student Manager (C# Console App)

## 📌 Overview

This is a simple **C# Console Application** that demonstrates **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of students.
The program uses a **menu-driven interface** that runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

It is designed for learning purposes, focusing on:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#.
* Organizing code with **Models** and **Services**.
* Exception handling and user interaction.

---

## ✨ Features

*  **Add Student** – Insert new students with ID, Name, Age, and Grade.
* **Update Student** – Modify existing student details by ID.
* **Delete Student** – Remove a student by ID.
* **Display Student** – View details of a single student by ID.
* **Display All Students** – Show all students currently stored.
* **Exit** – Close the program gracefully.
*  Confirmation messages after each operation.
*  Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., duplicate IDs, student not found).

## 🧩 Sample Code Snippet

```csharp
public void AddStudent(Student student)
{
    if (_students.Any(s => s.Id == student.Id))
        throw new Exception("Student with Same Id Already Exist");
    _students.Add(student);
}
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Save and load students from a file (JSON/CSV).
* Add input validation (prevent invalid values like negative age).
* Search students by name or grade.
* Unit testing for CRUD methods.
